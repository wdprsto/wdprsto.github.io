# Certification Images Directory

This directory contains certification images and issuer logos.

You should add your certification images and issuer logos in this directory with the following naming convention:

- Certification images: `certification-name.jpg`
- Issuer logos: `issuer-name-logo.png`

## Example

For a Google Cloud certification:
- Certification image: `google-cloud-developer.jpg`
- Issuer logo: `google-cloud-logo.png`

## Required Images for Demo

For the demo certifications in the YAML file, you'll need:
- `/assets/images/certifications/google-cloud-developer.jpg`
- `/assets/images/certifications/google-ml-infrastructure.jpg`
- `/assets/images/certifications/google-workspace-addons.jpg`
- `/assets/images/certifications/google-cloud-logo.png`

You can replace these with your own certification images and logos.
